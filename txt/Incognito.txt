In a world that is becoming increasingly invasive and litigious, the individual needs the tools to defend themselves against intrusions to their privacy while minimizing exposure to liability from governments and other powerful entities. The Incognito Project attempts to address this need and hopefully can help serve to restore the rightful freedoms that have slowly eroded over the years in many nations, and often never existed in many others. While having a political objective, the purpose of this project is far more pragmatic. It is simply to get the tools into the hands of individuals that help preserve their rightful freedoms, and in a form that is easy to use by the average freedom lover.

Overview
--------

The objective of the Incognito Project is to produce an easy to use distribution including as many of the relevant tools advancing privacy, anonymity and security as is practical, as well as documenting how to use it, how to recreate it, and how to improve upon it.

The Incognito distribution is minimalist distribution based on Ubuntu linux, enhanced with tools which advance privacy, anonymity and free trade in a secure environment.

KeePassX is an application for people with extremely high demands on secure personal data management.

http://openjdk.java.net/[Open JDK]::
The primary goal of the OpenJDK project is to produce an open-source implementation of the Java SE 6 Platform. Java is required by I2P and if installed, Freenet. There may be licensing issues with pre-installing Sun Java, although both I2P and Freenet recommend Sun Java.

http://www.osiris-sps.org/[Osiris Serverless Portal]::
Software for decentralized portal, managed and shared via P2P between members.

http://www.truecrypt.org/[TrueCrypt]::

What is not Included
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For various technical reasons, a some relavant applications could not be included in this distribution. Links are provided in the menus for information about and the ability to download these applications.

.Applications not Included

http://freenetproject.org/[Freenet]::
    Share files, chat on forums, browse and publish, anonymously and without fear of blocking or censorship!

    This was not included both because it does not set up well as a system application and because it has very large working files (about 1GB).

http://www.stealthnet.de/en_index.php[Stealthnet]::
    StealthNet is based on the original RShare client and has been enhanced by a developer team who consists of Planet Peer community members. In comparison with the current RShare client StealthNet offers a lot of new features like download resuming (interrupted downloads can be resumed), multilanguage support, a search filter for several file types and much more.

    This was not included because the Linux port must be run under Mono (Linux port of .Net) and the only interface available is the command line interface (CLI). Thus it is better presented on
Windows with a full GUI interface.

https://joindiaspora.com/[Diaspora]::
    Share what you want, with whom you want.

    Not included due to lack of maturity.

http://status.net/[Statusnet]::
    StatusNet is the world's leading Open Source social software. Its OnDemand and OnPremise options power collaboration for small teams and global corporations. Not included due to lack of maturity.
